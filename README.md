# Unsupervised Learning: K-means Clustering on Country Data
![alt text](https://help-international.org/sites/default/files/images/CAM21488.jpg)
This project focuses on Unsupervised Learning technique called K-means Clustering which is applied on socio-economic data of 167 countries with the aim of categorising the countries.

# Problem Statement
The HELP organisation is looking to provide financial aid to countries which are economically backward and in direst need of the aid. The HELP organization has raised around USD10 million and wants to effectively manage and distribute that funding to the countries in need.

# Task:
Classify the countries in categories based on their socio-economic and health factors which determine the overall development of the country.

# Data description:
There are 10 socio-economic and health factors for 167 countries.

# Method:
For this analysis, I opted for KMeans Clustering out of the other algorithms like Hierarchical Clustering. I have carried out the below process in this project.

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis - with useful insights
3. Visualizations of the important features
4. Managing outliers in the data
5. Scaling the data
6. Model building - Finding optimal number of clusters
7. Model fitting and predicting the cluster labels
8. Exploring the characteristics of each cluster
9. Conclusion

The code for this project is in the following pdf file - [unsupervised_learning_kmeansclustering.pdf](https://github.com/Vatsal-2414/Country-Data-Kmeans-Clustering/files/10825124/unsupervised_learning_kmeansclustering.pdf)

In addition, the clustered countries are highlighted in a world map which can be seen in this image file. This world map showing the three classified groups was produced using Plotly module in Python. - ![Categorized_Countries_World_Map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63712490/221548879-8e36df83-0859-4b51-8f08-7e12ace598c4.png)
